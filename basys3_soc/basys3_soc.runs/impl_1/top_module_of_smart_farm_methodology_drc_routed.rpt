TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.506 ns between dht11_control_instance/dth11/count_usec_reg[15]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and dht11_control_instance/dth11/humidity_reg[6]/CE (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
